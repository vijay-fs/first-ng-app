### **Advanced Animations & UX**

#### **Home Page Animations**

- **Fade Up Animation**: Elements slide up with fade-in effect (600ms ease-out)
- **Zoom Out Animation**: Hero sections scale in from 110% to 100% (800ms ease-out)
- **Stagger Effects**: Sequential animation of multiple items (300ms delay between items)
- **Above-the-fold Optimization**: Critical content loads immediately without animation delay

#### **Checkout Flow Animations**
- **Slide-in Entry**: Checkout page slides in from right (300ms ease-in)
- **Form Fade-in**: Form sections appear with upward motion (400ms ease-out)
- **Processing Sequence**: 4-step animated progress with realistic timing:
  1. "Validating order..." (1s)
  2. "Processing payment..." (1s) 
  3. "Confirming inventory..." (1s)
  4. "Preparing shipment..." (1s)
- **Pulse Animation**: Processing spinner grows/shrinks during order processing
- **Bounce Success**: Success message bounces in with spring effect (500ms cubic-bezier)
- **Progress Bar**: Animated width changes with shimmer overlay effect

#### **Interactive Component Animations**
- **Scroll-to-Top Button**:
  - Slide-up entrance from bottom (300ms ease-in-out)
  - Bounce feedback on click (200ms scale animation)
  - Hover lift effect with enhanced shadow
- **Cart/Wishlist Drawers**:
  - Bootstrap Offcanvas slide-in from right
  - Delete button hover effects with scale transform
  - Quantity button press animations
- **Product Cards**:
  - Heart icon color transitions for wishlist toggle
  - Button hover states with transform and shadow effects

- **Form Validation**: Real-time visual feedback for form states
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions between loading and content states
- **Shadow Effects**: Dynamic shadow changes on hover and focus states

#### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms use `will-change` property
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences
- **Efficient Triggers**: Animations use `transform` and `opacity` for 60fps performance
- **Smart Intersection**: Only animates elements when they enter viewport
